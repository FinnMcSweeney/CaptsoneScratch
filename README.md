</br>
<h2> Project Overview </h2>

<p>The main focus of this project is to use data from country emissions, air quality and population and find trends and correlations between these datasets.  In addition to looking at graphs to answer our initial questions, machine learning models will be used to look at future totals in emissions.  The data will be cleaned, analyzed and dashboards will be created to look at realtime data as it relates to our datasets and graphs. </p>

<h2> Datasets </h2>
<ul>

<h2> Initial Questions </h2>
<ol>
<li>Is an increase in population over time correlated with growing emissions?</li>
<li>As emission levels rise, what effect does this have on the air quality status in certain regions?</li>
<li>What are the countries with the highest emissions? Does this relate to population or GDP more? </li>
<li>Is there a direct cause and effect relationship between emission levels and air quality</li>
<li>What will emission totals be in 10 years? 20 years?</li>
<li>How do different pollutants (Coal, Oil, Gas, Cement, Flaring) vary across different regions? How do these vary in the United Stares?</li>
<li>Can comparisons be made between distribution of emissions/air quality to GDP?</li>
<li>How have emissions of a certain pollutant/air quality changed over time in a specific region? </li>
</ol>
